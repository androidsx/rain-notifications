Tests for Weather Assistant, with Robolectric 

Do not attempt to run them from Android Studio. You will not manage, and then you'll try, you won't manage, and you'll feel miserable.

Instead, run `./gradlew test` for Robolectric and `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` for Espresso tests.

The results are in (rain-notifications/tests/)build/test-report/debug/index.html
